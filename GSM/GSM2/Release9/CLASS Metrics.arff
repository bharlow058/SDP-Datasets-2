%-- Title: GSM2 /Software defect prediction
%-- Date: January, 1st, 2009
%-- Data from a GSM company, Istanbul, Turkey
%-- Donated by: Software Research Laboratory (SOFTLAB), Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey

%Description:
%-- Nine projects from application and presentation layers of the telecommunication software
%   Name: GSM1,GSM2,GSM3,GSM4,GSM5,GSM6,GSM9,GSM10,GSM11
%-- Ten releases from these projects are selected.
%   {Release 1, ..., Release 10}
%-- Package, File, Class and Method metrics are collected. 
%   {PACKAGE Metrics, FILE Metrics, CLASS Metrics, METHOD Metrics}
%-- Static code attributes and CK object oriented metrics are collected using Prest  Metrics Extraction and Analysis Tool [1]. 
%
%--An example of method level static code attributes are as follows:
%@attribute 'Cyclometric Density' numeric
%@attribute 'Decision Density' numeric
%@attribute 'Essential Density' numeric
%@attribute 'Branch Count' numeric
%@attribute 'Condition Count' numeric
%@attribute 'Cyclometric Complexity' numeric
%@attribute 'Decision Count' numeric
%@attribute 'Essential Complexity' numeric
%@attribute 'LOC' numeric
%@attribute 'Total Operands' numeric
%@attribute 'Total Operators' numeric
%@attribute 'Unique Operands Count' numeric
%@attribute 'Unique Operators Count' numeric
%@attribute 'Halstead Difficulty' numeric
%@attribute 'Halstead Length' numeric
%@attribute 'Halstead Level' numeric
%@attribute 'Halstead Programming Effort' numeric
%@attribute 'Halstead Programming Time' numeric
%@attribute 'Halstead Volume' numeric
%@attribute 'Maintenance Severity' numeric
%@attribute 'Formal Parameters' numeric
%@attribute 'Call Pair Length' numeric
%
%-- Object oriented metrics, collected in class level, are as follows:
%@attribute 'Coupling Between Objects' numeric
%@attribute 'Fan In' numeric
%@attribute 'Number of Children' numeric
%@attribute 'Percentage of Pub Data' numeric
%@attribute 'Response for Class' numeric
%@attribute 'Weighted Methods' numeric
%
%-- Defects can only be matched with file ID's. Therefore, pre-release test defects with file ID's are 
%represented in the corresponding xls file of the projects (test defects.xls). 
%
%-- Each project has been implemented/changed in different releases. Moreover, each release does not 
%necessarily contain all projects which has defect logs. Therefore, projects have different releases 
%in their seperate folders.
